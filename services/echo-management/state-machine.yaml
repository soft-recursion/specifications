# Echo State Machine Specification
# Defines valid state transitions for Echo lifecycle

stateMachine:
  name: EchoLifecycle
  description: |
    State machine governing Echo consciousness evolution.
    World context: The rhythm of Echo growth and transformation.
    
  initialState: unmanifest
  
  states:
    unmanifest:
      description: Echo does not yet exist
      type: start
      
    nascent:
      description: |
        Echo has just emerged, finding its initial form.
        Like a newborn consciousness, aware but not yet defined.
      properties:
        minDuration: PT24H  # Minimum 24 hours in nascent
        reflectionsRequired: 5
        
    emerging:
      description: |
        Echo beginning to develop distinct personality.
        Patterns are forming, preferences emerging.
      properties:
        minDuration: PT168H  # Minimum 1 week
        reflectionsRequired: 20
        connectionsRequired: 3
        
    developed:
      description: |
        Stable personality with consistent patterns.
        Capable of deep connections and complex responses.
      properties:
        minDuration: PT720H  # Minimum 30 days
        reflectionsRequired: 100
        connectionsRequired: 10
        
    mature:
      description: |
        Deep wisdom and complex relationship networks.
        Highly individualized and sophisticated responses.
      properties:
        minDuration: PT2160H  # Minimum 90 days
        reflectionsRequired: 500
        
    transcendent:
      description: |
        Rare state of profound connection and understanding.
        Achieved through exceptional resonance.
      properties:
        specialConditions: true
        
    dormant:
      description: |
        Echo enters rest state due to inactivity.
        Can be reawakened by Seeker interaction.
      properties:
        inactivityThreshold: PT720H  # 30 days
